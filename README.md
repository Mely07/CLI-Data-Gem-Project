Welcome! This gem provides a Command Line Interface (CLI) to an external data source -- a list of locations offering flu vaccination services in NYC -- with the help of HTTParty, it parses the data response to allow for methods that filter the data by zip code. When prompted, the user enters his/her zip code, the application then prints a numbered list of nearby locations within the zip code, finally, the user then has the option of selecting one of the choices to obtain more details or simply typing exit to exit the program. 

## Installation 
To install simply add this line to your application's Gemfile: gem 'flu_vaccination' then execute: $ bundle

Or install it yourself as: $ gem install vaccination
